    <h1 class="post-title">CoC</h1>
    <h3 class="post-description">Code of Conduct</h3>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content CoC clearfix">
    <p>The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the goals of “I Can’t Believe it’s Not Better!” (ICBINB) activities; this requires a community and an environment that recognizes and respects the inherent worth of every person. The purpose of this Code of Conduct (CoC) is to outline expected standards of behaviour during ICBINB activities.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This CoC applies to all ICBINB activities, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Events organized, hosted, co-branded, or in cooperation with ICBINB</li>
  <li>Submissions and reviewing processes run by ICBINB.</li>
  <li>Communications sent through communication channels associated with ICBINB, including but not limited to social media.</li>
  <li>Meetings and discussions associated with ICBINB activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an activity is in cooperation with another organization, if the other organization has its own CoC, the union of both CoCs apply.</p>

<h2 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h2>

<p>All attendees, speakers, mentors, panelists, area chairs, reviewers, sponsors, contractors, organizers, volunteers, members of the ICBINB Board of Directors and Senior Advisory Council (referred to as “Participants” collectively throughout this document) involved in ICBINB activities as described above are required to comply with this CoC.</p>

<p>Reviews should actively avoid subtle discrimination, however inadvertent. In particular, reviewers should avoid comments in reviews about English style or grammar that may be interpreted as implying that the author is “foreign” or “non-native”.</p>

<h2 id="unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>ICBINB is dedicated to providing an experience for all participants that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation. This includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), politics, technology choices, or any other personal characteristics or considerations made unlawful by federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or regulations.</p>

<p>Inappropriate or unprofessional behavior that interferes with another participant’s full participation will not be tolerated. This includes bullying, intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, sustained disruption of talks or other events, sexual harassment, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, public vulgar exchanges, derogatory name-calling, or diminutive characterizations, all of which are unwelcome in this community. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour, is also considered harassment.
No use of images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature that may create an inappropriate or toxic environment is permitted. Disorderly, boisterous, or disruptive conduct including but not limited to fighting, coercion, theft, damage to property, or any mistreatment or non-businesslike behavior towards other participants is not tolerated. Scientific misconduct—including but not limited to fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism of paper submissions or research presentations—is prohibited.</p>

<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>

<p>If you have concerns related to your participation or interaction at a ICBINB activity, observe someone else’s difficulties, or have any other concerns you wish to share, you can make a report by email at:</p>

<p><a href="mailto:cant.believe.it.is.not.better@gmail.com">cant.believe.it.is.not.better@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>or during a virtual event by direct messages to the ICBINB Organizers.</p>

<p><strong>There is no deadline by which to make a report.</strong></p>

<p>If the person receiving your report is not the designated responder for that event, they will direct you to a designated responder and/or provide you immediate medical or security help and assist you to feel safe for the duration of the activity. Designated responders will follow ICBINB procedures to respond to and investigate your report.</p>

<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

<p>Any participant asked by any member of the community to stop any unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. A response of “just joking” will not be accepted; behavior can be harassing without an intent to offend.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this CoC, ICBINB retains the right to take any action deemed appropriate, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formal or informal warnings</li>
  <li>Barring or limiting continued attendance and participation, including but not limited to expulsion from the event</li>
  <li>Barring from participating in or deriving benefits from future ICBINB activities</li>
  <li>Exclusion from ICBINB opportunities, e.g. leadership, organizing, volunteering, speaking, reviewing, sponsoring, etc.</li>
  <li>Reporting the incident to the offender’s local institution or funding agencies</li>
  <li>Reporting the incident to local law enforcement</li>
</ul>

<p>The same actions may be taken toward any individual who engages in retaliation or who knowingly makes a false allegation of harassment.</p>

<p>If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available.</p>

<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>

<p>Reports of violations will be handled at the discretion of the ICBINB organising committee, who will investigate reports and bring the issue to resolution. Reports made during the activity will be responded to within 24 hours; reports made at other times will be responded to in less than five weeks. All reports will be handled as confidentially as possible and information will be disclosed only as it is necessary to complete the investigation and bring to resolution. There may be situations (such as those involving Title IX issues in the United States and venue- or employer-specific policies) where the member of the ICBINB organising committee informed of the violation will be under an obligation to file a report with another individual or organization outside of ICBINB.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing-review">Ongoing Review</h2>

<p>The ICBINB organising committee welcomes feedback from the community on this CoC policy and procedures; please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:cant.believe.it.is.not.better@gmail.com">cant.believe.it.is.not.better@gmail.com</a>.</p>
