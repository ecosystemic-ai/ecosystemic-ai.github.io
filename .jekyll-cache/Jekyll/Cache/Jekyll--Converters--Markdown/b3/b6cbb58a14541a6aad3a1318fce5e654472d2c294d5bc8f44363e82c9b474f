<h3 id="what-are-breakouts">What are breakouts?</h3>

<p>A breakout is a 30min informal discussion that will take place at <strong>14:15-14h45pm EST</strong> on the official <a href="https://eventhosts.gather.town/app/yRI5WRxMd1kkR08S/ICBINB">Gather.Town</a>. The goal of this session is to share experiences related to the selected topic, find common interests, identify challenges/opportunities for improvement,  and brainstorm about ways to improve the research process overall. Each breakout will be moderated by a senior researcher, the organizers of the workshop will also be around, in case you want to meet us :)</p>

<p>Topics include:
    1. Role of Beauty in Machine Learning research
    2. Role of Negative Results - ‚Äúfile drawer‚Äù
    3. ‚ÄúBroken science‚Äù / incentives, reviewing, benchmarks</p>

<p>If you want to participate in one of these sessions, you just have to go to the corresponding ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù in the virtual Gather.Town world. Each carpet is a private space where you can listen to or talk to everyone else. There is one whiteboard available in each breakout. You are welcome to come by and leave anytime!</p>

<p>The topics are wide on purpose, so that participants have the freedom to lead the discussion to wherever they want. Here some ideas for discussion:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share experiences related to the topic</li>
  <li>What is the biggest challenge?</li>
  <li>Why is it difficult to fix?</li>
  <li>What should we be doing differently?</li>
  <li>How do we encourage the sharing of negative results?</li>
  <li>How to save papers from the graveyard of forgotten papers</li>
</ul>
