### Workshop at HHAI'22

For too long, algorithms have been perceived as simply abstract and value-neutral artifacts. However, this is far from true nowadays, as these are embedded in the world we live in and deeply interconnected with our social, cultural, political, economical and environmental systems, both in terms of their underpinnings and their impacts. The aim of this interdisciplinary workshop at the <a href="https://www.hhai-conference.org/">Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence Conference</a> is to put a spotlight on the need to introduce broader socio-technical and socio-ecological perspectives to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will leverage a Social-Ecological-Technical Systems approach considered in designing an algorithmic impact assessment process for a particular algorithmic system.

<h4>The objective of this workshop</h4>
To build a safe space to discuss together what it takes to put humans and ecology at the epicenter of developing AI technology. Firstly, by going beyond simply looking at ‘the algorithm’ or AI’s ‘turning knobs’ and instead engaging with the wider context and impact of these technologies, as well as with the assumptions with which these technologies are introduced in mainstream AI and policy discourse. Secondly, by brainstorming what is needed to build a framework that allows diverse stakeholders involved or affected by AI systems to evaluate and ensure these are built in ways that truly contribute to beneficial and sustainable outcomes for our social communities and planet, in the short and long term. From there, importantly, we hope to better understand more general lessons and approaches for how to put AI technology (if possible and desirable) at the service of the pressing social and ecological global issues we are experiencing.  

Among others, we aim to discuss the following: 
* What are current systemic challenges related to AI technologies  in our societies and environment? 
* How do AI communities tend to perceive these challenges and issues? 
* How can a socio-ecological-technical systems lens help us understand these challenges more integrally? 

Mapping various couplings between the technical, social and ecological, provides a ground to better reflect on our role as developers, scholars, policy makers, advocates, citizens. And to inform new modes of analysis and design that allow for pluralism. Here we turn our attention to what we can learn from the recent history in environmental justice. Based on a more integral and plural understanding of systemic challenges related to AI systems, what mechanisms or structures could we lean on to mitigate systemic risks and negative consequences? And perhaps as a starting point: What mechanisms or structures could help to steer the discourse away from technocentrism towards a more holistic and systemically responsible discourse that is both critical and constructive? If so, what incentives are needed to build broader forms of solidarity towards such changes? In particular, what does this mean for research?

This workshop is open to everyone and does not intend to be a one-off event. Our long term plan is to create an interest group around these topics, learning from each other and building a community that can, together, replace techno-centric perspectives with socio-ecological-technical ones.
